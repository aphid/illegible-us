some packages you need:
ffmpeg 
tor, optionally
ffmpeg probably wants x264, libopus and some other stuff

slimerjs may also take some setup (you need to point it at a recent firefox install) -- pls mind slimerjs's firefox version requirements too.

imagemagick might need more RAM to convert pdfs: https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/396
