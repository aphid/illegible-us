some packages you need:
php-cli php-bcmath php-curl php-simplexml exiftool ffmpeg 

ffmpeg probably wants x264, libopus and some other stuff

slimerjs may also take some setup (you need to point it at a recent firefox install) -- it's used to get the flash injected authentication stuff from the streaming server and to take screenshots of the pages.
