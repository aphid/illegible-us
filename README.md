illegible-us is a scraper for the hearing archive of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI)

the scraper collects hearing-related media (PDF documents and video) and metadata (location, time, witnesses, media-associated metadata).

illegible-us is written in node and has a number of dependencies beyond npm's scope: ffmpeg, youtube-dl, exiftool, and puppeteer (a headless chrome; fwiw i'd prefer puppeteer-firefox but setting up proxy is too annoying)
